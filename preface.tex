\label{cha:preface}

\LaTeX{} typesets text as \textit{What You See Is What You Type}
compared with \textit{What You See Is What You Get}. It gives
finer control over text layout with a host of commands and
add-ons. This book firstly demonstrates how \LaTeX{} supports
Chinese typesetting and then moves on to syntax. A bit of ACTeX
with Emacs configuration and key bindings are dicussed as
well. Gradually, topics from different disciplines (i.e. math and
language) are introduced in separate parts.

Priorly, I just planned to learn \LaTeX{} through trial and
error. As it progressed, I found \LaTeX{} an awesome typesetting
tool, creating beautiful text output. Hence, I decided to make
it a book containing different parts, covering formal subjects
like math, physics, etc. Ultimately, I want to maintain a
centralized offline jottings which can be testified by the book
title \textit{Miscellanies}.
